Cosmology with Redshift Space Distortions

This code is designed to produce power spectra for various gravity models to inspect whether general relativity is an accurate description of gravity on cosmological scales.
Spherical Fourier-Bessel analysis is performed within complex cosmological models to determine any deviation from general relativity comparing \lambdaCDM and f(R) gravity models.
"THESISFINAL.py" imports the cosmological model from "xcosmo.py", the spherical bessel functions from "xcls.py" and utilises window functions from "window funcs.py" to formulate a coordinate system and calculate the power at various distance intervals in real space.
